ASSIGNMENT 3: Functions & Modules in PythonModule 4: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains the Python solutions for Assignment 3, which focuses on demonstrating proficiency in writing and utilizing functions, as well as working with built-in modules, specifically the math module.

The assignment is divided into two distinct tasks:
Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a FunctionProblem Statement

Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number.Functionality
A function named factorial is defined that accepts one numerical argument.
The function uses an iterative (loop) or recursive approach to compute the factorial.
The function returns the calculated factorial value.
The main part of the program calls the factorial function with a sample number (e.g., 5) and prints the result.
Example Expected Output

For an input of 5, the program should return 120.
Task 2: Using the Math Module for CalculationsProblem Statement

Write a Python program that performs various mathematical calculations on a user-provided number by utilizing the standard math module.Functionality
The program prompts the user to enter a number.
The program uses functions from the math module to calculate and display the following for the input number:
Square root (math.sqrt())
Natural logarithm (log base e) (math.log())
Sine of the number (assuming the input is in radians) (math.sin())
Example Expected Output

For an input of 25, the output should display the calculated values for the square root, natural log, and sine of 25.
Submission & Repository Structure
This repository contains the two required Python scripts (e.g., task1_factorial.py and task2_math_module.py).
This README.md file provides a clear description of the programs' functionality.
All scripts are tested and include necessary validations and error handling to ensure they work as expected.
